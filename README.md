This a chatbox that uses an api (Recipe - Food - Nutrition) from RapidApi.com.
Initially my goal was to create a chatbox that would scrape the recipes from the gracefoods.com website but I had an issue with third party blockers so I decided to just use an API intstead.
The main goal was to create a chat box where users could input a search and it would generate recipes form the grace website (I'm still working on this cause I think it'd be really cool but in the meantime)
